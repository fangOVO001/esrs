## Project Overview
In this project, I initiated the backend project, utilizing Flask and SQLAlchemy to implement user login, registration, and user management functionalities. The primary goal at this stage was to establish the foundational framework and implement basic features.

### Designing Database Models
Firstly, I designed the database models. I created a model named User, which includes basic fields such as id, email, and password_hash.

### Creating Flask Application Framework
Subsequently, I initialized the Flask application and configured it accordingly, preparing it for subsequent development work.

### Implementing User Login Functionality
User login functionality is crucial, so I created a login page template and wrote the corresponding form validation logic. User authentication functionality was implemented to ensure that the username and password entered by the user match the records in the database.

### Implementing User Registration Functionality
The registration feature is equally important. I created a registration page template and implemented the corresponding form validation logic. This allows new users to easily join our platform, with their information being saved to the database.

### Implementing User Management Functionality and Adding Admin Dashboard Interface
User management functionality is a key focus for us in subsequent stages. Therefore, I designed the layout of the admin dashboard interface and embedded user management functionality within it. This allows administrators to easily manage users, and the interface is designed to be clean and visually appealing.

### Next Steps
Next, I plan to further enhance user management functionality, including adding permissions control and role management features. Additionally, I will consider adding other management functionalities to adapt to app development.
