## Discussion

1. Purpose of the Meeting

The purpose of this meeting was to discuss and evaluate a new price comparison shopping app designed specifically for Chinese people living in the UK (including students), addressing their needs for price comparison in shopping.

2. Market Research Report

At the start of the meeting, the market analyst presented a report indicating that there is a lack of applications on the market that cater to the price comparison needs of Chinese people living in the UK. Most shopping apps do not support a Chinese interface and lack a dedicated price comparison feature for Chinese consumers.

3. Product Introduction

The product manager introduced the newly developed app. This application uses crawler technology to automatically fetch product information from major shopping platforms, updating in real-time to help users find the best prices. The design of the product interface is as follows:

Product Information: Primarily displayed in Chinese, making it accessible and usable for Chinese speakers.
Operational Interface: Primarily in English, ensuring compliance with local requirements in the UK.

4. Future Development Plans

The team discussed future plans for the product. Plans include adding English product descriptions in future versions to expand the target user base, not only serving Chinese users but also attracting more non-Chinese users.

5. Issues and Discussion

Some issues and suggestions were raised during the meeting, such as ensuring the legality of the crawler, data security, and user privacy protection. The team agreed to focus on these issues in subsequent development.

6. Meeting Summary

The meeting concluded by summarizing the main points discussed and planning the next steps for the project. The team expressed optimism about the project's prospects and planned to complete the development and testing of the first version in the coming months.

## Summary

1. Static Generation Web Frameworks

Static generation web frameworks are a popular choice for building websites due to their performance and security benefits. These frameworks generate static HTML files during the build process, which can be served directly to users without the need for server-side processing. 

Use Vitepress for static generation web frameworks to build develop log websites.

2. Github Actions

Github Actions is a powerful tool for automating workflows in software development projects. By defining custom workflows in YAML files, developers can automate tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.

Use Github Actions to automate the build and deployment process of Vitepress websites.

3. MVC Architecture in Web Development

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a common design pattern used in web development to separate concerns and improve code organization. The model represents the data and business logic, the view represents the user interface, and the controller handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

* Flask is a lightweight web framework that follows the MVC architecture, making it a popular choice for building web applications.
* Sqlalchemy is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that simplifies database interactions in Flask applications.

4. Web Scraping with Python

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated scripts. Python is a popular language for web scraping due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.

Use `requests` libraries in Python for web scraping tasks.


5. Android Development with ReactNative **【Not Native Application】**

React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms.

Use React Native for Android app development to leverage its cross-platform capabilities and developer-friendly features.
